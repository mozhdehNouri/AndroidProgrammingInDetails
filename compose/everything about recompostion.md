When we say Composable functions are "idempotent," it means that when you run them multiple times with the same inputs, they produce the exact same result. This property is crucial for the way Jetpack Compose manages UI updates.

In Jetpack Compose, when the inputs to a Composable function change, it needs to update the UI accordingly. This process is called recomposition. However, the system is smart about it: it only recomposes the parts of the UI tree that actually need updating.

To do this, Jetpack Compose traverses down the UI tree, checking which parts need to be recomposed based on changes in input. If a part of the UI doesn't need to be updated because its inputs haven't changed, Compose can skip recomposing it. This skipping is possible only if the Composable function associated with that part of the UI is idempotent. Essentially, Compose can trust that if the inputs are the same, the output will be the same too, so there's no need to re-run the function. This efficiency is vital for smooth UI updates without unnecessary re-execution of code.
