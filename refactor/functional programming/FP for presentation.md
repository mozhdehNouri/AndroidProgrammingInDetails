Like OOP Functional programming or FP is a way to organize your code. FP can help make your code clear and understandable. Maintenance can be a lot easier with functional programming. And then finally you avoid repeatable code. And this follows that dry principle of don't repeat yourself, you don't want to repeat code or write code in different places that do the same thing.

Any program consists of two main things data and behaviors. Data is usually an object or an array or something like that. Behaviors are functions now with object oriented programming, We saw that these two things were combined. With functional programming, these two things are separated.
Data is completely separate from the behaviors which are the functions. These two things are not combined. Now, another way to say this is that data is manipulated by passing it through a series of functions. One function acts on a piece of data and then returns a new piece of data. That new piece of data is then passed into another function, and this continues until we achieve the desired effect.


**Functional Programming**
Functional programming is the form of programming that attempts to avoid changing state and mutable data. In a functional program, the output of a function should always be the same, given the same exact inputs to the function. This is because the outputs of a function in functional programming purely relies on arguments of the function, and there is no magic that is happening behind the scenes. This is called eliminating side effects in your code.
**For example**, if you call function getSum() it calculates the sum of two inputs and returns the sum. Given the same inputs for x and y, we will always get the same output for sum.

Functional programming provides the advantages like efficiency, lazy evaluation, nested functions, bug-free code, parallel programming. In simple language, functional programming is to write the function having statements to execute a particular task for the application. Each small function does its part and only its part. The function can be easily invoked and reused at any point. It also helps the code to be managed and the same thing or statements does not need to be written again and again. It allows for very modular and clean code that all works together in harmony.


**What is OOP ?** 
Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm in which you program using objects to represent things you are programming about (sometimes real world things). These objects could be data structures. The objects hold data about them in attributes. The attributes in the objects are manipulated through methods or functions that are given to the object.
For instance, we might have a Person object that represents all of the data a person would have: weight, height, skin color, hair color, hair length, and so on. Those would be the attributes. Then the person object would also have things that it can do such as: pick box up, put box down, eat, sleep, etc. These would be the functions that play with the data the object stores.
The main deal with OOP is the ability to encapsulate data from outsiders. Encapsulation is the ability to hide variables within the class from outside access — which makes it great for security reasons, along with leaky, unwanted or accidental usage. Most programmers using object oriented design say that it is a style of programming that allows you to model real world scenarios much simpler. This allows for a good transition from requirements to code that works like the customer or user wants it to.


Comparison:
Cons of functional programming…. it really takes a different mindset to approach your code from a functional standpoint. It’s easy to think in object oriented terms, because it is similar to how the object being modeled happens in the real world. Functional programming is all about data manipulation. Converting a real world scenario to just data can take some extra thinking.
Object-oriented languages are good when you have a fixed set of operations on things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things. This can be accomplished by adding new classes which implement existing methods, and the existing classes are left alone.
Both Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses a different method for storing and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects. The object-oriented programming is widely used by the programmers and successful also.


Functional programming is the programming technique that accentuates the functional factors required for creating and implementing programs. OOP or Object-Oriented Programs are conceptual programming techniques that use objects as the key. The programming model used in functional programming is declarative, while object-oriented programming uses the imperative programming model. In functional programs, variables and functions are the main elements of the code, while in object-oriented programs, objects and methods are the key elements.
