For example, they can use AppOpsManager to prevent an app from accessing the camera. or you can use AppOpsManager to keep an eye on and control things like camera usage, location access, file access, or accessing contacts.

- AppOpsManager can  be used to create apps with enhanced security features by ensuring that only allowed operations are performed, based on user or system preferences.

- AppOpsManager has methods for starting and stopping operations, which can be useful for logging and monitoring how your app is being used.
