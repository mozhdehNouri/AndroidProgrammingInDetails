**Include unidirectional data flow , immutable State and the use as a function.**

MVI architecture can indeed be combined with other architecture patterns, such as MVP or MVVM, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the app.
One way to think about it is that MVI provides a framework for managing the state and interactions within the app, while other patterns like MVP or MVVM focus on how the different components of the app communicate with each other. For example, you could use MVI to manage the state of a view model in an MVVM architecture.

The model in MVI architecture is different from the model in other patterns like MVP or MVVM. In those patterns, the model typically refers to a collection of classes and functions that represent the data and business logic of the app. In MVI, on the other hand, the model is more of a functional mechanism that takes the output from the intent and manipulates it to produce the next state of the app. This state can then be used to update the UI or perform other actions.
So, while the MVX acronym is sometimes used to refer to a group of architecture patterns that share certain similarities, it's important to remember that each pattern is still unique in its own way and has its own specific implementation and purpose. For example, while MVI, MVP, and MVVM all share the "M" for model, the way the model is used and the role it plays in each architecture can be quite different.

MVI pattern focuses on the single source of truth principle to provide immutable states to other layers and unidirectional and immutability of states that represent the result of user actions and configure UI screens. MVI works on top of the other patterns, such as MVP or MVVM, with state management mechanisms, which means MVI architecture can bring the Presenter or ViewModel concepts depending on your architectural.

- **Intent**:**Intent**is a definition of interfaces and functions that handle user actions (UI
  events, such as button click events). The functions transform UI events into **Model**’s interfaces and deliver the result to **Model** for manipulating it. Intents are then translated into state changes of the Model.
  Intent is a definition of interface and functions that handle user actions. the intent functions teransform ui event into model and deliver the result to model for manipulate.
  
  - **Model**is a functional mechanism that takes the output from **Intent**and manipulates it to
  UI states that could be rendered in **View**. The UI states are immutable and come from business logic. Essentially represents the state of the view at any given time. It’s immutable, meaning once it’s created, it cannot be changed.
  Model is functional mechansim that take the output from intent and manipulates it to ui state that could be render in view.
  
  - **View**: **View**in MVI has the same responsibilities as MVP and MVVM, which represents the screen  and user interactions, such as listeners, and does not contain business logic. One of the biggest differences in implementation from other patterns is that the MVI ensures unidirectional data flow, so**View**renders UI elements depending on UI states that come from the **Model**.

**MVI in action**
In the view we have some event happen like click button or text change so we tell the viewModel this event heppend. we can say our view like fragment or activity or screan dosen't konw what happend when a click event happend. the view just say a button was clicked and the the viewModel is the thing controll every thing. that is what will decide what to do when a button clicked.

View -> nothing to know about what happend.
Model -> responsible for return data.
functional -> every thing in mvi should be represent by a function those function are pure.
Intent-> for intent consider android camera intent you fire camera intent and override onActivityResult() and waiting for result same happend for intent in mvi.
MVI arch work that principle. you fire specific intent with sealdClass usuall and you observe the result of the intent and when you get the result you update your ui.

MVI focus of single-source-of-truth to provide immutable states to other layers.
and MVI works top of the other patterns such as mvvm , mvp with state management mechanisms.

**MVI atop MVVM**: You may have encountered some architectural approaches that mix components from different patterns. For example, using ViewModels with MVI would mean that you still structure your data and state management around the ViewModel as in MVVM, but you would introduce the concept of Intents from MVI for state and event handling.
MVI’s strong focus on unidirectional and cyclical data flow can make state management more predictable compared to MVVM and MVP.
Mvi is like close system every thing is specify. There is no way something to go wrong. Event get fire and result is returned. Every thing is handled this is very organized. every thing is really nicely encapsulate. each fragment is refrence to the specify interface.
