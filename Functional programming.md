What is Functional Programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions.

1- Null Safety: Null references are controlled by the type system.
2- Immutability: val allows you to define read-only properties.
3- First-Class Functions: Functions are treated as values that can be assigned to variables.
4- Higher-Order Functions: You can pass functions as parameters or return them from other functions.
5- Extension Functions: You can “add” new methods to existing classes without modifying their source code.


**Functional programming : **

abstracting into functions and  using functions and using functions as first-class citizens 
there is noting any kind of magic to any of this it is essentially the idea that i am abstracting functions and using them 
this leads me to the idea this i can understand this in a little bit in easier way 
So  do we want functions to be accurate do we want functions to be honest about what they're doing and honest functions are sometimes referred to as total functions which means that for ant input provided there is a output that is going to be computed  
the opposit of total function is a partial functions which means that for certain inputs there isn't an output now in maths the synonym to a total function.

we look at the abstraction of functions but we also want to try and make sure our functions are correct that for every input there is an output.
other aspect of a function is what we call a function that dosen't have side effects.

something like map function is part of the standard library which means it basically comes as part of it and you can just use it all time- all impelemention is exist.
one of the aspects people that do functional programing or generally you want to try and the idea od immutablity that i dont change  things as i work with them because if i changing things if i am changing values its becomes harder to test.it is more error pron and all of those horrible
